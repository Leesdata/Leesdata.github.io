## Hello, my name is Lee! 
Thank you for visiting. I hope this website helps you start getting to know me. I'm always to connect and chat:)




## About me in brief

I believe in the power of data as a tool to gain insights about people and organizations. 

My eagerness to develop proficiency with data tools comes from the desire to understand the status quo and strategize for the future. 

I aspire to be an experienced problem-solver and communicator, focusing on data visualization and technology implementation. 

With interdisciplinary background (social science, business, information science) and technical skill sets (R, Python, Tableau), I look for opportunities to exert my passion for analytics and innovation across sectors.
