## About me

I believe in the power of data as a tool to gain insights about people and organizations. My eagerness to develop proficiency with data tools comes from the desire to understand the status quo and strategize for the future. I aspire to be an experienced problem-solver and communicator, focusing on data visualization and technology implementation. With interdisciplinary background (social science, business, information science) and technical skill sets (R, Python, Tableau), I look for opportunities to exert my passion for analytics and innovation across sectors.
